### Addressed Problem Statements and Steps

#### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
**Objective:** Dynamically display metrics like Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, Order Count, and Profit Margin.

**Steps:**
1. Import the Orders Table into Power Query for processing.
2. Create calculated columns:
   - **Profit Margin**: `Profit / Sales`
   - **Total Orders**: Count of `Order ID`
3. Use Excel formulas to compute:
   - **Total Sales**: `=SUM(Sales)`
   - **Total Profit**: `=SUM(Profit)`
   - **Total Quantity**: `=SUM(Quantity)`
4. Create a dynamic KPI table with visual enhancements (e.g., symbols like ‚Äúüí∞‚Äù for Total Sales).

| Metric           | Calculation          | Symbol |
|------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Total Sales      | Sum of Sales         | ‚Äúüí∞‚Äù |
| Total Profit     | Sum of Profit        | ‚Äúüìà‚Äù |
| Total Quantity   | Sum of Quantity      | ‚Äúüì¶‚Äù |
| No. of Orders    | Count of Order IDs   | ‚Äúüõí‚Äù |
| Profit Margin    | Sum of Profitability | ‚Äúüîπ‚Äù |

#### 2. Sales and Profit Analysis
**Objective:** Visualize sales and profit trends.

**Steps:**
1. Create a Pivot Table grouping `Order Date` by Year and Month.
2. Add `Sales` and `Profit` as values.
3. Design a Line Chart for trend visualization.
4. Integrate Slicers for dynamic filtering by category, market, or region.

#### 3. Category-Wise Profit
**Objective:** Evaluate profit across product categories.

**Steps:**
1. Create a Pivot Table with `Category` as rows and `Profit` as values.
2. Sort data by descending `Profit`.
3. Develop a Bar Chart to display category-wise profit.
4. Add Slicers for year and region-based filtering.

#### 4. Segment-Wise Sales Share (%)
**Objective:** Visualize sales share by customer segment.

**Steps:**
1. Build a Pivot Table with `Segment` as rows and `Sales` as values.
2. Compute percentage share: `Sales / Total Sales * 100`.
3. Create a Pie or Donut Chart for visual representation.
4. Include labels for percentage values.

#### 5. Sales by Country
**Objective:** Analyze sales performance by country.

**Steps:**
1. Develop a Pivot Table with `Country` as rows and `Sales` as values.
2. Sort data in descending order of `Sales`.
3. Apply Conditional Formatting or Heatmaps to highlight top-performing countries.
4. Optionally, use a Geographic Map Chart for a global view.

#### 6. Top 5 Subcategories
**Objective:** Identify top-performing subcategories.

**Steps:**
1. Build a Pivot Table with `Sub-Category` as rows and `Sales` as values.
2. Sort by descending `Sales` and filter to show Top 5 Subcategories.
3. Design a Column Chart for visualization.

#### 7. Bottom 5 Subcategories
**Objective:** Highlight underperforming subcategories.

**Steps:**
1. Use the same Pivot Table but sort by ascending `Sales`.
2. Filter to display Bottom 5 Subcategories.
3. Develop a Column Chart with contrasting colors for emphasis.

#### 8. Yearly Sales Trends
**Objective:** Track yearly sales trends.

**Steps:**
1. Group `Order Date` by Year in a Pivot Table.
2. Add `Sales` as a value.
3. Create a Line Chart to illustrate trends.
4. Enable Slicers for filtering by category, region, or segment.
